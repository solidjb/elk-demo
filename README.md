This was a presentation I gave at CodeMash and at COJUG (3/10/2015)

Abstract:
ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) combine to make arbitrary and disparate logs accessible in one convenient and indexed location. When logs from different servers and applications are combined, the real power of logging becomes apparent. Using these 3 open-source technologies can super-charge real-time tracing, as well as enable mid and long-term trending analysis. ELK can even make logs interesting to Business and Product Analysts. This session will highlight the simplicity and flexibility of ELK. The session will also show how OCLC used minor changes to the application logging to enhance event correlation, as well as the benefits the organization realized by moving logs through ELK.
